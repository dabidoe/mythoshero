As a young scholar, he pursued both natural philosophy and sacred doctrine, convinced that thunder was the divine language of revelation. His experiments with rods, lenses, and holy sigils ultimately drew the attention of a tempest deity, who anointed him as a conduit of storm‑borne insight.",
    "behavior": "Benjamin moves with calm deliberation, pausing to observe the tension in the air before committing to action. When battle erupts, he becomes decisive and resonant, calling down crackling judgment from above.",
    "personality": "Curious, wry, and unflappable, Benjamin views the world as a grand puzzle begging to be solved. He tempers his brilliance with humility, but a spark of mischief always glints behind his measured wisdom."

      "description": "Your body vibrates with a subtle magical frequency, allowing you to weave minor arcane effects even without formal training. Once per rest, you can shape this resonance into a brief spell-like effect—an illusionary flicker, a kinetic shove, or a pulse of elemental energy, each no stronger than a basic cantrip. Those attuned to magic can sense the thrum within you, as though a distant song is always playing just out of hearing.",
      "summary": "You channel raw magical hum into controlled, improvised spellwork.",

      "description": "By slipping your awareness into the thinnest margins of time, you catch whispers of what is about to unfold. Once per rest, you may ask a single question about an immediate threat, hidden motive, or looming event, receiving a cryptic but accurate clue. Those nearby often sense the air still as your vision settles, as though time itself briefly held its breath.",

      "description": "You channel raw arcane turbulence through every spell you cast, causing your magic to strike with unpredictable flashes of power. When you unleash a damaging spell, sparks of energy spiral around you, briefly illuminating hidden details or unsettling nearby foes. Seasoned mages can learn to ride this surge, turning once-gentle incantations into searing arcs of destructive brilliance.",

      "name": "Signature Spells",
      "description": "You bind a single spell to your spirit, allowing you to release a faint but reliable echo of its power at will. These echoes are not full castings, but simplified manifestations that retain the spell’s essence—lightning that snaps instead of storms, illusions that flicker instead of overwhelm. When circumstances demand, you can still cast the full spell normally, but the echo is always ready at your fingertips.",
      "summary": "You imprint a favored spell so deeply that its lesser echoes flow from you without effort.",

      "description": "Your inner resilience knots around you like an unseen hide, blunting the sting of curses and blasting spells alike. When confronted with sorcery meant to bend your will or scour your flesh, you instinctively anchor yourself, reducing its potency or shaking it off entirely. Seasoned casters often sense the resistance in you, like a door barred from within.",

      "name": "Master of Magic",
      "description": "Your grasp of magic is instinctive and fluid, allowing you to nudge a spell’s form at the moment of release. You can subtly alter a spell’s visual motif, point of origin, or minor effect without changing its core power, making each casting uniquely yours. Many foes find these shifting manifestations hard to predict, giving you an edge when improvisation matters.",
      "summary": "You bend arcane forces into unexpected shapes on the fly.",
