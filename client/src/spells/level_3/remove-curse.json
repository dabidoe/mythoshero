  "description": "You unleash a surge of cleansing force that targets a single curse clinging to a creature or object you touch. Minor and moderate hexes unravel instantly; more entrenched maledictions crack but may not fully break, instead weakening for a short time. This magic cannot unbind curses tied to a being’s core essence.",
