  "description": "You tap a creature or object, igniting a tiny mote of floating starlight that hovers within 5 feet of the target. The mote sheds bright light in a 15‑foot radius and dim light for another 15 feet. As a bonus action, you can move the mote up to 20 feet to a point you can see. The mote winks out if it leaves your range or you create a new one.",
