  "description": "You cloak a willing creature in shimmering ward-light imperceptible to all but you. For the duration, the target gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or possessed. The first time each round a creature targets the warded ally with an attack or harmful spell, the aggressor must succeed on a Wisdom save or have the effect fizzle harmlessly. The aegis fades early if the target strikes a creature or forces a hostile saving throw.",
