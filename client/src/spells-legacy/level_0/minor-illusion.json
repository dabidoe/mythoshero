  "description": "You conjure a fleeting glimmer or whisper that briefly distracts creatures within sight or hearing. The illusion fits within a 5‑foot cube and can appear as a flicker of light, a shifting silhouette, or a soft hiss. A creature may use its action to inspect the effect and, on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, identifies it as false. The illusion offers no sensory substance beyond sight or sound.",
