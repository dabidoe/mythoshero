If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—-within 30 feet-—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a *[polymorph](../polymorph/ \"polymorph (lvl 4)\")* spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.\n\nThis spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.",
