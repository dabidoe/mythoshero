You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.\n\nIf you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature travelling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.",
