The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *[wall of force](../wall-of-force/ \"wall of force (lvl 5)\")*.\n\nA creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.\n\nA disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *[true resurrection](../true-resurrection/ \"true resurrection (lvl 9)\")* or a *[wish](../wish/ \"wish (lvl 9)\")* spell.\n\nThis spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.",
