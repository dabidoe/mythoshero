  "flavorText": "You send a thin strand of psychic sound toward one creature you can see. The target alone hears your brief message in its mind and may respond in a faint thought only you can perceive. The thread can bend around corners but cannot pass through magical silence or antimagic effects.",
  "description": "You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\n\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.",
