This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of th esame creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.\n\nAt any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul tranfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restured to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.",
