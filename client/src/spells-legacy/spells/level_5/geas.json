If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.\n\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\n\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
